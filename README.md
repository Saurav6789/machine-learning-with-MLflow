# machine-learning-with-MLflow
In this project , we are demonstrating how MLFLow  can be used in machine learning. MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It simplifies experiment tracking, reproducibility, model management, and deployment.

## Overview 

MLflow provides four main components:

- **Tracking**: Logging and organizing experiments.
- **Projects**: Packaging code into reproducible runs.
- **Models**: Managing machine learning models.
- **Registry**: Managing and versioning models in a central repository.

## Installation

pip install mlflow
